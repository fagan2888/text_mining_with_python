13,02-28-2019,Business,The economy appears to have dodged a bullet at year-end -- but the coast is not clear ... Relative to history the inventory accumulation in the second half of 2018 is large and threatens to overshadow production schedules (and manufacturing-related employment) in the first half of this year. Analysts should carefully scrutinize industrial surveys such as the manufacturing ISM for signs of a production lull intended to work off inventory excess.
