8,08-13-2018,Business,What drove the market?
9,08-13-2018,Business,U.S. investors continued to closely monitor developments in Turkey. The Turkish central bank pledged in a statement Monday to provide “all the liquidity the banks need.” It also said banks would be able to borrow foreign-exchange deposits from the central bank at one-month and one-week maturities. Analysts said Turkey’s reluctance to raise interest rates stood out.
10,08-13-2018,Business,However those events failed to curb concern about possible contagion from Turkey’s currency crisis with market participants fretting that the tumble in the lira USDTRY +0.3902% could ripple though financial markets hurting emerging-market economies. Concerns also remain about exposure of European banks to a weakening lira.
11,08-13-2018,Business,The Turkish lira extended its slide with one dollar buying 6.974 lira compared with 6.427 lira late Friday a decline of 6.4% for the currency after a double-digit plunge Friday. At the lira’s lows a dollar bought 7.131 lira.

14,08-13-2018,Business,What were market participants saying?
15,08-13-2018,Business,“We’re going through a rolling crisis phase. Markets have become so stretched in terms of nerve that any headline risk becomes a source of investor angst. I don’t see Turkey as a significant risk but investors are very worried about what the next headline risk is going to be ” said Tom Stringfellow who oversees about $14 billion as chief investment officer for Frost Investment Advisors.
16,08-13-2018,Business,“The bottom line is that the volatility seen in overseas currency markets does not change the immediate picture for the stock market. The market continues to be driven by improving economic conditions. This is underscored by a report last week showing confidence among small businesses at an all-time record high which bodes well for continued strength in the labor markets ” Bruce Bittles chief investment strategist at Baird said in a note. “The largest negative on the horizon is the reluctance of either the U.S. or China to back down from tariff threats which could eventually lead to a slowing of global economic growth.”
